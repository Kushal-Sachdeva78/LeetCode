# LeetCode Solutions

A collection of my solutions to LeetCode problems — written mainly in **C++**, with several in **Python**, and a few in other languages.  
This repo tracks my problem-solving journey, focusing on clean, efficient, and well-structured code.

## About
I solve LeetCode problems daily to strengthen my algorithmic thinking, coding speed, and analytical depth.  
Each solution is written from scratch — not just for acceptance, but for complete understanding of the underlying logic and patterns.

---

## Languages Used
- **C++** — primary language (fast, powerful, STL-based solutions)  
- **Python** — secondary (used for quick testing and simpler logic)  
- **Others (rare)** — Java / JavaScript for variety or specific syntax challenges

---

## Topics Covered
Covers *almost every major LeetCode domain*, including:
- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists  
- Hash Maps, Sets, and Heaps  
- Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Stack, and Queue  
- Recursion & Backtracking  
- Dynamic Programming (1D, 2D, State-based)  
- Trees, Graphs, and BFS/DFS  
- Binary Search, Sorting, and Greedy Algorithms  
- Bit Manipulation, Math, and Number Theory  
- Prefix Sums, Intervals, and Advanced DP  
Basically — **everything LeetCode has to offer.**

---

## Goal
To master problem patterns, strengthen data structures & algorithms intuition, and build consistency through practice.
